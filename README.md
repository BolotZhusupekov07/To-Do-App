# To-Do-App

We came to the idea of this project after seeing the Trello board. This is a medium-level project, the concept of which is to clearly know what you are doing now, what you will do and what you have already done.

## Screenshots:

### This is what the app looks like

As you can see, there are 3 boards here and each board has its own functionality(buttons doing, skip, done, clear and do later)

### You can use the save button to save your entries in a text editor and then open them using the open button

You can also hear recordings from your boards using the speak button.
